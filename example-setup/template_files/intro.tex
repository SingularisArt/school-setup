INTRO_TYPE notes from the course \MyTitle, given by professor PROFESSOR at the \faculty~at \location~in the academic year \academicyear, in the \term. This course covers COVERS. Credit for the material in these notes is due to professor PROFESSOR_SHORT, while the structure is loosely taken from the LOCATION textbook. The credit for the typesetting is my own.

\textit{Disclaimer:} This document will inevitably contain some mistakes--both simple typos and legitimate errors. Keep in mind that these are the notes of an undergraduate student in the process of learning the material himself, so take what you read with a grain of salt. If you find mistakes and feel like telling me, I will be grateful and happy to hear from you, even for the most trivial of errors.
